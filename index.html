<h1>Ayaka</h1>

<p>Welcome to my website. I am Ayaka. I would be delighted if you could find on my website that we share the same interests in our daily lives.</p>

<p>My interests are mainly concentrated in two areas. Firstly, for contemporary languages, both widely spoken and under-resourced, I wish to design artificial intelligence that has the ability to understand and process them, so that our lives can benefit from technology. Secondly, for the historical development of languages, I wish to explore how ancient languages of different geographical areas and different ethnic groups have been shaped into what they are today, and what they will become in the future.</p>

<p>To address this first problem, I have made natural language processing the primary goal of my life. By virtue of my background in computer science, I have easily gained a good grasp of the architecture of the state-of-the-art models and started to focus on the processing of languages itself. At present, I am pre-training large-scale natural language models using Google Cloud TPU.</p>

<p>For low-resource languages, while humans can be adaptive in choosing appropriate methods to master them, current AI is unable to do so. Therefore, my long-term objective is to find a proper transfer learning method that enables the AI to automatically master low-resource languages without human supervision, given the comprehensive data available on the Internet.</p>

<p>To tackle the second problem, I regard the mastery of the history of a language on its own as a pre-requisite. Towards this end, I have been acquiring a substantial amount of knowledge in historical linguistics. For the Chinese language, on the basis of my mastery of the Qieyun phonological system, I have developed the widely adopted qieyun-js programming library. For the Japanese language, I am conversant with the history of Japanese kanji pronunciation and can fluently read any text written in kanji using on'yomi.</p>

<p>Subsequently, I have studied many groups of similar languages or dialects to increase my understanding of the evolution of languages, incorporating the knowledge of the history of migration and molecular anthropology. For instance, in addition to my proficiency in Mandarin and Cantonese, I am also familiar with the Hakka and Teochew dialects. For North Germanic languages, I am simultaneously learning Norwegian, Danish and Swedish. With an intuitive understanding of language evolution, I have been able to speculate on the future of languages based on the common beliefs, culture, public policies and social movements.</p>

<p>In addition to my two passions above, I am familiarising myself with web development in order to bring my creations to the world. Besides, I love learning more than a dozen programming languages, including Haskell, which is even more than the natural languages I can speak. I also enjoy singing, plane-spotting, typography, stargazing and Indian cuisine.</p>
