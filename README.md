# Ayaka’s Personal Website

## Why a personal website?

A personal website is an invaluable tool for anyone looking to establish their online presence. Whether you are a student, a professional, or simply someone looking to express their individuality, a personal website can provide a platform to showcase your talents, achievements, and interests. Additionally, it provides a valuable opportunity to connect with others who share your passions and to build a network of like-minded individuals.

## Why a personal English website?

After previously having a Chinese personal website, I have decided to create a new one in English. This is to further demonstrate my fluency in English and to reach a wider audience. In today's interconnected world, the ability to communicate effectively in English is a valuable asset, and I am eager to showcase my proficiency in this language through my personal website.
